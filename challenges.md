## Limits of Data

<b>The full picture of defence strategies are not included in public white papers.<b>

For obvious reasons, intelligence might be excluded from public white papers for strategic interest. Our study assumes that white papers are reflective of how US allies perceive threats levels from China and the DPRK, however intelligence and other hidden sources are likely to disclose the true perception of threat. 

<b>The US has a number of allies in the Asia Pacific, however alliances are often subject to change overtime.<b>

It is therefore difficult make an assumption about US alliesâ€™ perceived threat level if there is uncertainty as to who the allies are at any given time. Not all US allies release white papers, so therefore we can only analyse the US allies that do choose to release whitepapers. Our study therefore has the caveat that our analysis of perceived threat is based on US allies who release white papers. 

<b>Further, not all US allies release white papers in English, which further limits our access.<b> 

For ROK and Japan, we have to rely on translations of whitepapers. The true extent of perceived threat levels might be lost in translation from Korean and Japanese to English, even if we rely on official translations. 

<b>Not all US allies who do release whitepapers do so on a uniform basis.<b>

Therefore it is hard to make an assessment over time country by country on an annual basis, and instead we have to group the countries together as a whole. That being said, we can still analyse a selection of countries on any given year to do an intra-country analysis. For example, Australia only released a white paper in 2009, 2013, and 2016; ROK only released a white paper in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016; and Japan released a white paper annually. 

<b>By grouping countries together as a whole, those countries that do release annual white papers will be disproportionately represented in the analysis.<b> 

This is not a major problem, however, because the goal is to analyse perceived threat levels from US allies, not necessarily specific US allies. As can be seen, if each country released white papers on a uniform basis we would have a plethora of data available for analysis which would strenghthen our study. The lack of data on each country, however, does not necessarily hinder our analysis. It might have been beneficial to identity a region with countries that regular release white papers and analysing that allotment of countries instead. This would mean changing the perceived threast (DPRK and China), but it would allow us to look more in depth at how white papers highlight emerging threats. 

## Limits of Methodology

<b>Our study importantly goes beyond qualitative analysis due to the breadth of the data used.<b> 

The large data set we used would take a ridicuously long period of time to study quantiatively. Our study overcomes such potential barrier by using quantiative analysis involving the use of temporal evolution and network analsysis. A major issue in both types of analysis used - temporal evolution and network analysis - is linking the results to the assumed causes. For example, although we may have found that international cooperation is becoming more popular in white papers, we were unable to link this to the threat from the DPRK and China. 

<b>Moreover, the growth of international cooperation might be a trend throughout the world.<b> 

In this case, our analysis would only inform the reader what they are likely to know already, which furthermrore may not be a significant trend for the countries under analysis. In regards to the types of analysis we used, cooccurence networks might not fully explain the relationship between different threats described in the white papers It only provides an elementary of the connections betweens threats and how a government perceives them. Temporal evolution analsyis on the otherhand might not contemplate third factors that influence on perceptions of threat overtime, which impact on threat perceptions of DPRK and China but not necessarily directly.
