# Challenges

<b>Methodological</b>
- The full picture of defence strategies are not included in public white papers
- The US has a number of allies in the Asia Pacific, however alliances are subject to change overtime
- Not all US allies release white papers 
- For ROK and Japan, we have to rely on translations of whitepapers 
- Not all US allies who do release whitepapers do so on a uniform basis 
- By grouping countries together as a whole, those countries that do release annual white papers will be disproportionately represented in the analysis 

<b>Technical</b>
- Problems with Cortext
- Encountered some Chinese coding
- Could be overcome with some reformatting work
