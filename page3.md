# Challenges

<b>Methodological</b>
- The full picture of defence strategies are not included in public white papers. For obvious reasons, intelligence might be excluded from public white papers for strategic interest. Our study assumes that white papers are reflective of how US allies perceive threats levels from China and the DPRK, however intelligence and other hidden sources are likely to disclose the true perception of threat. The US has a number of allies in the Asia Pacific, however alliances are often subject to change overtime. It is therefore difficult make an assumption about US alliesâ€™ perceived threat level if there is uncertainty as to who the allies are at any given time. Not all US allies release white papers, so therefore we can only analyse the US allies that do choose to release whitepapers. Our study therefore has the caveat that our analysis of perceived threat is based on US allies who release white papers. Further, not all US allies release white papers in English, which further limits our access. For ROK and Japan, we have to rely on translations of whitepapers. The true extent of perceived threat levels might be lost in translation from Korean and Japanese to English, even if we rely on official translations. Not all US allies who do release whitepapers do so on a uniform basis. Therefore it is hard to make an assessment over time country by country on an annual basis, and instead we have to group the countries together as a whole. That being said, we can still analyse a selection of countries on any given year to do an intra-country analysis. For example, Australia only released a white paper in 2009, 2013, and 2016; ROK only released a white paper in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016; and Japan released a white paper annually. By grouping countries together as a whole, those countries that do release annual white papers will be disproportionately represented in the analysis. This is not a major problem, however, because the goal is to analyse perceived threat levels from US allies, not necessarily specific US allies.

<b>Data and Analysis</b>

- Just make sure when you design your website to highlight possible limitations (regarding the data, the analysis strategy) and possibly propose some alternatives ideas (again at the data and analysis levels).

<b>Technical</b>
- After first attempting to upload the papers to Cortext, it was found that some of the original text file were uncoded in utff16 (instead of utf8) and some even in Chinese encoding. In a nutshell, some weird characters were messing up things on Cortext. This problem was overcome with some reformatting work.
