# Methodology


## Temporal Evolution

For each country, we used frequency analysis to see whether and how the language of the country's white papers would change over time.

## Cross-regional Co-occurence

Network mapping was used to find related terms within white papers across countries. Therefore, network maps were generated for each country displaying the co-occurence of terms in the white papers after 2000.
  
## Cross-temporal Co-occurence

The same approach was used to compare how the use of terms in the white papers changed per country over time. To this end, the corpus of each country was split (mostly into one data set containing the papers from before 2010 and another containing those from after 2010) and network maps were generated for each of the time periods.
