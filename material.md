# Research Material

The questions were examined using a corpus of national defense white papers of Australia, Japan and South Korea from the years 2000 to 2017. For further information on the choice of data go to <i>Challenges<i>.

The following two white papers from Australia (2000) and South Korea (2010) serve to illustrate the characteristics of the corpus and reflect some of the findings.

## Australia defense white paper 2000

The Australian paper from 2000 deals with a range of issues that are not directly connected to the region or regional strategies, such as science and technology or funding. The white paper also shows that, although the Southeast Asian and Wider Asian region are of significant importance to Australia's security, the relationship with the United States plays a predominant role in ensuring Australia's strategic interests and objectives. This corresponds to the findings from the cross-regional and the cross-temporal network mapping.

## Republic of Korea defense white paper 2010

The 2010 paper of South Korea is an example for a very comprehensive white paper. A possible reason is that South Korea is more inclined to perceive the threat to its national security from North Korea as more immediate. North Korea is a major concern for South Korea, which describes it as "a serious threat to global security beyond Northeast Asia". The white paper further comprises dealings between South Korea and North Korea that are unique to their relationship as neighbouring countries and therefore cannot appear in Australia's and Japan's white papers, including repatriation of prisoners of war and military confidence-building measures.
