# Research Material

The questions were examined using a corpus of national defense white papers of Australia, Japan and South Korea from the years 2000 to 2017. For further information on the choice of data go to <i>Challenges<i>.

The following two white papers from Australia (2000) and South Korea (2010) serve to illustrate the characteristics of the corpus and reflect some of the findings.

## Australia defense white paper 2000

The Australian paper from 2000 is a good example of a Western country's rather elaborated and comprehensive white paper. It deals with a range of issues that are not directly connected to the region or regional strategies, such as science and technology or funding. The white paper also shows that, although the Southeast Asian and Wider Asian region are of significant importance to Australia's security, the relationship with the United States plays a predominant role in ensuring Australia's strategic interests and objectives. This corresponds with our findings from the cross-regional and the cross-temporal network mapping.
