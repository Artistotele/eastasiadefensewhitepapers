### Republic of Korea

> What is seen in the case of ROK is an increased emphasis on the international collaboration over time â€“ with higher frequencies of terms related to the UN Security Council, Defense Cooperation, Enforcement, Decrees, and the International Community. There are increased mentions os ballistic missiles and North Korea, yet terms such as Nuclear test and Nuclear weapons have remained farily consistent over the past decade, as have other, more charged terms such as Readiness posture.
