## The South China Sea Dispute

This research project aims to shed light on how the defence strategies of US allies in the Asia Pacific have changed as the threat to their security from People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) evolved over time. For our purpose, defence strategies, as contained in the whitepapers of Japan, South Korea and Australia, are considered a mirror image of these countries perception of their security environment – which is not necessarily in line with the factual development of relevant inter-state conflicts.

While many scholarly efforts have been channelled into qualitatively pointing out myriads of strategic implications flowing from these conflicts, a data-driven, quantitative analysis is yet to be added to existing research in this important field. Our project thus seeks to partly fill this gap.

## Questions of Interest

- How have the defence strategies of US allies in the Asia Pacific changed as the threat to their security from China and the DPRK evolved over time?

- How do the different US allies in the Asia Pacific perceive the threat to their security from China and the DPRK? Are there cross-regional differences?
